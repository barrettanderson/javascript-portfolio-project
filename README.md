Welcome to the Cocktail Lab.

To enter the lab, mix your own cocktails, follow the instructions below.

In your terminal

1. CD into the backend at 'backend-api'.
2. Enter 'bundle install' (to install necessary gems)
3. Enter 'rails db:migrate' (to migrate the necessary databases)
4. Enter 'rails db:seed' (to seed the data.  It has one test cocktail, but the necessary ingredient seed data is found here)
5. Enter 'rails s' to get the server up and running (it will be running on http://localhost:3000/)
6. Open a new terminal (for app to work, one terminal has to be running the server on the rails side)
7. CD into the frontent at 'frontend'.
8. Open the file index.html in your browser.
9. Enjoy making some cocktails, which probably won't be as enjoyable as in real life, but hopefully will inspire you to great creativity!

Cheers!
