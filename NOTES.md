Join table for the ingredients and the cocktail.
    This could have the id of the ingredient and the cocktail and then the measurement


Questions for Laura
    Making the backend objects also be js objects - Do I need to be domething else in the JS to be deleting the objects?

    How am I integrating the join table model in the objects themselves?  Right now I have just cocktails, but where do ingredients come into play, and theen the join table

    How do I want to encapsulate the logic in rendering my ingredients.

    Laura had a class called form.  These only had static methods(class level methods)

    Ingredients - Find or create by method
    How to render the json - (use include keyword)
    Accepts nested attributes
        If they add ingredients

    Path to add nesting
    
    Create Ingredients
